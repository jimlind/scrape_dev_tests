Ruby Scraper

After I spent a bunch of time on that Node scraper I new that if I tried to run a script that was
going to eat memory it was going to crash surf and everything was going to be a loss. So I wrote
this as quick and dirty as possible so I can see how Ruby goes.

Unfortunatly, Ruby ate memory at about the same rate as Node and didn't let it go as fast as I
wanted to see it so I gave up on this version pretty quickly.
