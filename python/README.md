Python Scraper

After Node and Ruby I tried the next language on the list and it didn't leave as much memory
on the table. It kept things clean enough that surf didn't get closed and everything was
good. Things were going along great with this version and things were going great with this
version and I had accepted my fate as a slow scraper.

Then I realized that my bash downloader was routing everything through a proxy and I could 
probably abuse that proxy and speed things up a lot. That ended up being an excellent idea.

So this scraper never got finished either, but it came a lot further than the others.
