NodeJS Scraper

This was my first attempt at getting the scraper to work.
It worked for a few attempts but eventually Node would eat too much RAM and it would kill the browser.
Linux doesn't like it when any one process eats too much RAM and it kills what it wants.

After I tore it down to run almost nothing and I was still seeing the memory climb I decided to abandon it
so it's in bad shape.
